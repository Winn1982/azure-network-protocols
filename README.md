<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />



<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 24.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create a Windows 10 pro vm and a Linux (Ubuntu) vm
- Download Wireshark
- Observe various network protocols through Wireshark


<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

I Logged into the Windows 10 virtual machine that we created earlier and downloaded Wireshark. Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer.

The first thing we want to do with Wireshark is to start a packet capture and observe the normal traffic that a computer uses. The first type of traffic that we are going to capture is ICMP traffic. ICMP (ping) is used to test the connectivity of a host on a network.

I sent a ping request through Powershell onto the Linux virtual machine on its private IP address (10.1.0.5).

I then observed the request from the Linux virtual machine (10.1.0.5) and the replies from the Windows virtual machine (10.1.0.4).

I then pinged www.google.com from the Windows 10 virtual machine and observed the results of the request and reply.

I initiated a continuous ping from Powershell to the Ubuntu virtual machine and observed the traffic in Wireshark.

I then went into the Network Security Settings in my Linux virtual machine. I went to the Linux security group and configured an inbound security rule to block all ICMP traffic. I went back to my Windows virtual machine to observe the results of the implementation of the new rule.

I observed in Powershell that the traffic started to time out.

I also observed in Wireshark that the traffic stopped receiving acknowledgments and only received the ping request.

I then deleted the security rule to block all incoming ICMP traffic and observed the traffic results begin again in both Wireshark and Powershell.

I then "SSH into" the Linux virtual machine through Powershell and observed the traffic through Wireshark while typing random commands into Powershell.

I then filtered for dns traffic only in Wireshark. I typed nslookup google.com in Powershell and observed the traffic in Wireshark.

The last thing that was done with Wireshark was I searched for RDP(tcp.port==3389) traffic only and observed the constant stream of traffic as the RDP was always transmitting.
